# Simplicity

Welcome to **Simplicity**â€”the to-do list app designed for those who find traditional task managers overwhelming. We've intentionally stripped away unnecessary features to provide you with a clean, straightforward platform that focuses on what matters: your tasks.

## Features

- **Minimalist Design**: No clutter, no distractions. Just your tasks and deadlines.
- **Mandatory Deadlines**: Every task must have a due date to ensure you stay on track.
- **Task Descriptions**: Add details to your tasks to keep track of important information.

## Why Choose Simplicity?

In a world where productivity apps are becoming increasingly complex, Simplicity offers a breath of fresh air. By focusing on essential features, we ensure that managing your tasks doesn't become a task in itself. Our philosophy is rooted in the idea that the more complicated an app gets, the less you actually use it. Simplicity is designed to help you stop organizing and start doing.

## Getting Started

1. **Add Tasks**: Click the "+" button to create a new task.
2. **Set Deadlines**: Every task requires a due date to keep you accountable.
3. **Add Descriptions**: Include any pertinent details or notes about the task.
4. **Mark as Complete**: Once done, check off the task to remove it from your list.

That's it. No tags, no priorities, no complexities. Just a simple, effective way to manage your tasks.
